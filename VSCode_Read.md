To complete the commit message editing, you need to use the "save" action for that editor tab, and then close that editor tab. Using your keyboard, that's probably ctrl/cmd+s to save, and then ctrl/cmd+w to close.

Yes, it's not very intuitive, but at least it's consistent: That's how it works for pretty much every commandline-based editor if you do git commits not using -m on the commandline (Ex. in vim or nano): You'll also need to save and close the editor buffer.
